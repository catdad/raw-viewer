RAW viewer is a desktop app which allows you to quickly cull your photos. You can view, rate, manage, and delete all your RAW photos straight out of camera without requiring conversion or importing, allowing you to get to editing your best photos as fast as possible. This application focuses on ease of use and speed, removing all the lag your culling workflow.

All ratings are saved directly to the RAW file, so when you are done culling, you can import the remaining photos into Lightroom (or any other software) and all the ratings will show up.

Maybe you are under the impression that viewing RAW photos in your favorite program is already fast? Or maybe you've been told that RAW photos are really hard to work with and slow is just the nature of RAW photos? Well, RAW viewer is here to tell you that all of that is a lie and culling your photos can be fast!

# Download

You can get the latest Windows and MacOS versions here: https://github.com/catdad/raw-viewer/releases/latest

# Windows

This is a self-contained portable app. Unzip the download and run `Raw Viewer.exe`.

If you no longer wish to use this app, you can just delete the folder where you unzipped it -- but don't worry, all your photos as well as their ratings will stay right where you left them.

# MacOS

This is a self-contained portable app. Unzip the download and run `Raw Viewer`.

The first time you run it, it will fail to verify the app and tell you that you cannot run it. If this happens, open System Preferences > Security & Privacy. There, you will see a message at the bottom saying that Raw Viewer was prevented from opening with an "Open Anyway" button. Click that button and now you will able to run the app. You will only need to do this once on your computer.

If you are a developer and know more about how to sign the application, please let me knowat issue [#191](https://github.com/catdad/raw-viewer/issues/191).

If you no longer with to use this app, you can just delete the folder where you unzipped it -- but don't worry, all your photos as well as their ratings will stay right where you left then.
