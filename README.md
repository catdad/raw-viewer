RAW viewer is a desktop app which allows you to quickly cull your photos. You can view, rate, manage, and delete all your RAW photos straight out of camera without requiring conversion or importing, allowing you to get to editing your best photos as fast as possible. This application focuses on ease of use and speed, removing all the lag your culling workflow.

All ratings are saved directly to the RAW file, so when you are done culling, you can import the remaining photos into Lightroom (or any other software) and all the ratings will show up.

# Download

You can get the latest Windows and MacOS versions here: https://github.com/catdad/raw-viewer/releases/latest

# Windows

This is a self-contained portable app. Just unzip it and run `Raw Viewer.exe`

If you no longer wish to use this app, you can just delete the folder where you unzipped it -- but don't worry, all your photos as well as their ratings will stay right where you left them.

# MacOS

While a MacOS package is available, I do not currently have a Mac so I was not able to test the package (though the build system does run tests on a Mac). If you are able to test the app and improve the installation and uninstallation instructions here, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/catdad/raw-viewer/issues/new) or submit a pull request. All help is appreciated!

What _should_ work is simply unzipping the package anywhere and running `Raw Viewer.app`.

# Linux

Linux support is not quite there yet. If you would like to help, please see [this issue](https://github.com/catdad/raw-viewer/issues/105).
